Unofficial Siteore Training Session 4

- Install Sitecore 8.1 Update-3
- Install the .update file from *packages* folder using `/sitecore/admin/UpdateInstallationWizard.aspx`
- If you're using SIM to install Sitecore then use the default settings (so it is created as `http://sc81rev160519/`)
- Otherwise update the endpoint URL `TdsGlobal.config` if you want to sync the items using TDS (everything is in the .update file though, you don't need TDS)
